# This program is a casino slots game. The user will enter multiple inputs like their name and how many dollars they want to play with. There are multiple exit points at which the user can quit the game and the game will exit a user who runs out of money. The visual is meant to resemble a slot machine. There are line breaks and small time delays to allow a user to more easily read the program response output. The game will tell you if you won or # lost and ask if you'd like to play again if you have enough money for another round. The odds are against but gamble away.
